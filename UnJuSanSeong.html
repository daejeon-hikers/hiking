                This mountain containing the historical remnants of an ancient fortress (Seong or 성 translates to Fortress) dating back to
                Baekje (백제) Period (18 BC to 660AD), is located within the SeJong (세종시) City limits. At the time of our hike in April 2018,
                work was underway at the base of the mountain to develop this area into a national park and improve the area around this
                mountain to make the area more user friendly as the population of the new nearby city of Sejong (세종시) continues to grow. It
                is also a unique chance to learn more about the history of this region of Korea. This was most likely an important fortress
                during the period when Shilla (신라) together with Tang dynasty of China was unifying all of Korea in the 7th century and in
                any case was certainly an important military base during the Baekje (백제) period. From the Fortress walls there are extensive
                views in all directions.

                During Baekje (백제) times the huge mountain fortress stretched over several villages in the area. The outside fortress walls
                were 3098 meters in length and the inside fortress walls extended for 543 meters. The walls were made with stones which was
                the building material of choice at that time due to their plentiful supply and strength. That much of the walls can be
                walked along today is a testament to their construction techniques and strong will of the people of that period. One cannot
                help but be impressed by the size of the stone structure. Inside the fortress area are some tombs that also date back to
                Baekje (백제) times. During excavation much earthenware, ceramics and roof tiles dating from the Baejke period were recovered.
                Also located on this mountain is the temple 고산사 which contains the temple bells referred to as 백제삼천범종. The temple is a place
                to pray in order to comfort the spirits of former Baekje (백제) kings.

                The trail that we took starts at a complex that includes an exclusive restaurant and a place that has many large ceramic
                jars in which are stored Korean Traditional condiments such as KimChi (김치). The trail led up a very steep valley through the
                woods which were still vacant of new leaves, though the path had still the remains of last year’s leaves covering them. The
                location where we started was about 2 km from the peak. As usual in Korea, the trail was well defined and there were many
                signs that could guide you at any of the trail intersections. To encourage families to hike in the woods there were many
                strategically placed benches along the trail for resting. Along the way there were also signs telling about the history of
                the area. Our trail skirted around the peak and finally led up to steps that were made with wood but eventually become stone
                steps as we approached the summit.

            <div class="img_container right">
                <img src="images/mountains/UnJuSanSeong/tower.jpg">
            </div>
            <p>
                On the summit there is a large modern monument of granite shaped like a tower in a park like setting. Engraved on the
                monument are the words “백제의 얼 상징탑” which roughly translates to “a tower that symbolizes the spirt of Baekje”, meaning the
                enduring spirit of the people who were responsible for the construction of the fortress walls. Although the monument was
                built to convey the spirit of loyalty and wisdom of the Baekje (백제) people to their descendants, its existence typifies the
                honor which is still bestowed by the current Korean society on their ancestors. After looking over the summit area, which
                incidentally is an ideal place for a lunch break, we followed the well-marked path that leads down to the ancient reservoir
                that has the appearance of a large swimming pool. As we continued on, the great walls of the fortress came into view. These
                were some of the most impressive fortress walls that I have seen in central Korea.

                From here there was a road to follow but we needed to be careful as this was an active road with many cars travelling in
                both directions. Along the sides of the road were several beautiful flowering cherry trees proudly displaying their blossoms
                for us to enjoy. At the bottom of this road there were signs that indicated the direction downward until eventually we
                reached the Buddhist temple again then the parking area where the hike began. This hike is near to Daejeon, approx. 1 hour
                and 10 minutes driving from our starting point of KAIST and is one of the most historic of the mountains in the vicinity of
                the new city of SeJong which is approx. 20 minutes away by car. It is a good hike to plan for the spring as the trees are
                quite beautiful when they are abundantly adored with blossoms. Despite a few steep patches it is not a hard hike, suitable
                for families and the not so fit.
