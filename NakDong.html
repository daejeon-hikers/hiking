                This trip occurred during the month of August 2010. This is not the ideal time for a trip on a river in
                Korea, but it was the only time that my partner was available. I had worried about the monsoon but that
                year it had rained very heavily in July and August was dry. It did not mean that the monsoon did not
                affect us as the NakDong (낙동강) River had flooded in July and this added the difficulty on finding a
                location to land that was not covered with a fine mud deposited during the recent flood. This was the
                usual three day trip similar to the trip on the Guem (금강) River trip in 2008. The major difference with
                the last river was the lack of dams on this river. Related to the history of Korea this river had a
                significant role in saving South Korea from being overrun during the first months of the Korean War in
                1950. This river formed the front line of the war in July, August and the first half of September 1950.
                More information about the river is found at the end of this document. The proposal was optimistic as we
                never made it all the way to Busan. My canoeing partner for this trip would be Dr. Aviv Seger, a fellow
                professor at Korea Institute of Science and Technology, KAIST.

                Enclosed is the information requested regarding the planned canoe river trip on the NakDong (낙동강) River
                from Daegu (대구) to Busan (부산). The total length of the trip is 167 Km. We plan to start the trip on
                August 20th in the morning near the school of DaSanChung Kyeo, to the west of Daegu (대구) and travel by
                canoe downstream. We will canoe on the river the first day until the location where Route 67 crosses the
                river is reached; a distance on the river of about 25 Km. The closest location name is Ugok-myeon (우곡면).
                We will stay there overnight along the river and the next day at that location, August 21st, will
                continue downstream on the river to where Route 45 crosses the river at Chilseo-myeon (칠서면). The
                distance traveled that day is about 44 Km. On the third day, August 22nd, we plan to continue until we
                reach the location on the river where Route 55 crosses the river at Samgyeongri where we will camp along
                the river near the canoe. The distance traveled that day is 53 Km. The next morning, August 23rd, we
                will continue on to Busan City arriving in the afternoon of 23rd of August. The distance traveled that
                day is 45 Km. At Busan City we will take the canoe out of the river near Deadonggoungkyo and put the
                canoe on the roof of the car and return to Daejeon that evening.

                We loaded the car and put the canoe on the roof and left Daejeon (대전) for Daegu (대구) in the morning of
                Friday August 20th, 2010. It took up a while to find a location described above in the proposal where
                and we never did find the school mentioned in the above proposal. We drove along the road west of Daegu
                until it approached as near as possible to the river. Looking at the photographs you can see that we
                still had a good distance to traverse from the road to get all the gear and the canoe to the river’s
                edge. After completing this part of the trip I had to spot the car in Busan and return. Busan is the
                second largest city in South Korea and it took me a while to find a suitable parking area. That night I
                slept in the car. Early in the morning of the second day, Saturday the 21st, I returned to the canoe and
                we loaded up the canoe with the camping gear and food and were finally on the river by ten thirty. We
                soon encounter rapids under the bridges. A few of these required that we exit the canoe and look for the
                best approach to through the rapids. I always look to where the water is piling up and the waves largest
                as that location would be the deepest part of the river in the rapids. Around 6 p.m. after travelling
                about 45 kilometers we pitched the tent and prepared the dinner in a relatively clean location. We knew
                this as we had the print out of the river in a water proof container that we checked along the way.
                After our dinner, a group of Philippine workers from a local manufacturing plant came out on a motor
                cycle and went swimming in the river near us. They were curious as to what we were doing. They seemed
                very surprised when we told them that we were on the way to Busan and had been in Daegu that morning.
                They looked at us and looked at the canoe and shook their heads like we were crazy!

                The next morning, Sunday August the 22nd, we had eaten breakfast and packed the canoe ready to leave by
                8:30 when the owner of the manufacturing plant came out to greet us. Probably the Pilipino workers had
                told him about us that morning. He implied that we would never make it to Busan (He was right as we
                found out the next day). We were soon on the river passing large dredges that were a part of the Four
                Rivers Project, a major effort of the South Korean MB Lee Administration. A major goal of this project
                was to clean out the river channels of the four major Korean rivers decreasing the chance of flooding by
                increasing the capacity of the river channel. Much of this debris in the rivers was evidently caused by
                the denudation of the Korean hills during the Korean War of 1950-1953. We soon found that the major
                challenge for the trip would be the sun and related heat which sapped our energy and that combined with
                the slow current meant that we only made about 45 kilometers that day. We set up a camp site on a sandy
                bar around 6:30 in the evening. The next morning, we were back on the river by 8:30 and both of us were
                relieved that this was the last day. That meant that it would not be a full day of paddling as after
                that I had to go to Busan and retrieve the car because we had to be back at KAIST before too late in the
                evening. This part of the river was very smelly and had many clumps of pollution as shown in the
                photographs. In fact it was the largest amount of pollution that I have ever seen on a river. We also
                passed a few more dredges and found a location that seemed to be a gun emplacement at the base of a
                rocky cliff on the eastern side of the river. We had lunch there and continued on till we reached the
                location where two large bridges cross the river. This was a perfect location to end the trip as the
                road was near the river and there was also a bus stop in the nearby town that I could take a bus to
                Busan. My partner packed up while I arrived at the car around 4:30 p.m. and then to the location where
                we had landed with the canoe around 6:45 p.m. We arrived in Daejeon around 10:30 PM and waited until the
                next morning to take the canoe off the car roof, organize all the gear and return the canoe to its
                storage location. We may have reached Busan if we had continued on the next day, but I am not sure of
                this because of the slow current and the heat.
