                Prior to moving to Korea in 2002, I had a great deal of experience canoeing in the rivers and lakes of the eastern U.S.A. I
                had always enjoyed canoeing on both rivers and lakes. For two summers during my youth I had been a camp counselor on Lake
                George where I spent many weeks leading canoe and hiking trips in the Adirondack region of New York State. I have also
                kayaked a number of the rivers of both Germany and Austria when I spent a summer exploring those European rivers in Klepper
                Arius Fault Boats during the summer of 1958. I decided when we were preparing to move to Korea that I would not give up
                canoeing. Therefore when we moved to Korea we brought our Old Town Tripper Model 172 Canoe

                This model is the workhorse of Wilderness tripping canoes. Designed from the keel line up to meet the exacting requirements
                of backcountry expeditions, from its legendary durability to its expedition-tested padding efficiency and maneuverability.
                The tripper 172 has exceptional stability and a cargo volume that can be only described as massive….. a true hauler. We
                brought a Tripper 172 with us to Korea. It features polyethylene decks with grab handles; classic, standard – setting
                design; black blow molded seats; ash carrying yoke and thwart and black vinyl gunwales. Made from the patented material
                Royalex it comes in colors of green and red. Its length is 17 feet 2 inches or 5.2 meters with a width of 37 inches or 93.9
                centimeters.

                After I had spent a few years getting adjusted to Korea, my wife asked me when I was going to use the canoe. This was my
                impetus to plan a trip at the end of the university semester in June of 2008. I already knew that South Korea has four large
                rivers, The Hangang (한강) that passes through Seoul, the Nakdonggang (낙동강) that starts in the northwest and passes through
                Daegu (대구) and finally to Busan (부산), the GeumGang (금강) that is found in the Daejeon area and eventually flows to GunSan
                (군산) on the West Coast and the YoungSanGang (영산강) that starts north of the city of GwangJu (광주) and goes south to the port
                of Mokpo (목포) on the south coast. I also knew that Korea had many large lakes most of which were formed when dams were built
                on many rivers during the time of President Park Chun Hee (박정희). These dams serve an important agricultural function. Over
                eighty percent of the rain falls in the summer monsoon season. This means that the rest of the year there is little water
                available for agriculture and in the past many of the crops died due to lack of water. Now with the water stored in the
                dams, and an elaborate irrigation built this stored water is available to provide much water in the off monsoon season.

                An example of this is the Cheungjuho (충주호), a lake near the city of Cheungju (충주) and is one of the largest lakes in Korea
                (It is really a dammed river valley). I had driven along these rivers and lakes many times and knew that they would be a
                good venue for canoeing but the only way to really know is to plan a trip of a few days and get out onto the river that I
                have admired from the land. I had noted that seldom did I see any boats of any kind on the rivers. I found this curious
                because these rivers used to be the major navigational route during the Chosen Dynasty. This paucity of river traffic was
                confirmed during my trips. Seldom did we see any boats on the rivers. The exception was in the vicinity of a large city
                where there was a kayak club on the river and one time saw an excursion boat on the river. This excursion boat is one of the
                few that allows tourists to explore the beauty of Cheungju Lake (충주호) during the summer time and is very popular with
                Koreans.

                In the description of hiking in the mountains of central South Korea I discussed that the rivers in the mountainous areas of
                Korea are deeply incised and therefore have very narrow channels. This means that the water levels can fluctuate greatly
                depending on the amount of water coming from upstream. I also mentioned that many of the river channels are strongly
                influenced by the northeast and southwest trending rock joints or zones of weakness of Korea. This fact is shown in the
                section on geology in the introduction to hiking section where I show the map of fractures and the route of the GeumGang
                (금강) River. Another thing to note is that the rivers of Korea exhibit extreme seasonable changes in water flow. It is during
                the monsoon season that about ninety percent of the yearly rain falls on the Korean Peninsula. The exception to this rule is
                when a typhoon hits Korea. Therefore the best times of year to canoe are before or after the monsoon season and when there
                is no typhoon predicted to hit the peninsula. My favorite time to be on the lakes and rivers is June when the days are long
                and the autumn when the trees on the banks and surrounding hills are very colorful.

            <p>
                At the same time if there has been a flood on one of the rivers, it is best to avoid that one because the banks will be very
                muddy and difficult to set up a tent on or bring the canoe up to the road. Summertime is best to be avoided not only because
                of the rain and high river conditions, but also because when it is not raining, it is very hot and unpleasant during the day
                time when you are exposed to the sun from above and the sun reflection from the surface of the water. The major problem with
                canoeing in June is that the rivers may exhibit especially low water levels. At this time the river has not received much
                water since the summer before. I encountered this on one canoe trip after an especially dry spring. We were able to make it
                to the predetermined camp site that evening but there were many stretches of the river where we had to get out and walk the
                canoe until the water in the river channel was deep enough for us to continue on in the canoe. If it has been an especially
                dry spring, I recommend that one canoe on one of the large lakes. This is the reason on one canoe trip we chose a lake
                rather than struggle with the low water in one of the rivers. This made for an especially interesting trip as we were able
                to see many locations on the lake that were usually hidden under water.

                I was told that I needed to have permission to canoe on the rivers of Korea. Related to this I was told that one is not
                allowed to boat on the Han (한강) River as it is the water supply for the city of Seoul. I asked about this permission
                requirement and found that some foreigners had canoed on the Geum (금강) River and got into trouble and had to be rescued. I
                never found out more than this. So I asked one of our cousins here (a Korean) to inquire about us receiving permission to
                canoe on the first trip where we were travelling for three days from Daejeon to GunSan (군산) on the Geum (금강) River, the same
                river where others had run into trouble and been rescued. My cousin said that I had to write up a plan for the trip and also
                state my experience level, ability to swim and make a statement that Korea would not be legally responsible if we ran into
                trouble during the trip. After I complied with this requirement, I received a verbal from my cousin that we could go on the
                proposed trip.

                After that, I never had to receive permission for any of the future trips that I went on but I did notify my cousin of my
                plans prior to each future trip. I found out that the Korean Coast Guard is responsible for monitoring traffic on the South
                Korean Rivers and this is related to the ongoing war with North Korea. I certainly understand the importance of monitoring
                traffic on the rivers because the Korean War is still ongoing with only an armistice and no peace treaty in force. I would
                recommend that any foreigner planning a river or lake trip to check with the Coast Guard and notify them of your plans.

                Over the years I have done over eight river trips and two lake trips. All of the major rivers have dams. Some of these dams
                are small but recently there was the Four River Project when large dams were constructed. These sometimes have locks that
                open to let a boat through. This is true in theory but I was never able to pass a dam in this manner. We had to unload the
                canoe and carry it around the obstacle empty and go back and carry all the camping gear and food to the location decided
                upon for the continuation of the trip. There are also smaller dams that contain fish ladders. These made it easy to slide
                the canoe down the ladder. If the water was low we would put a mat on the rocks and slide the loaded canoe on this mat.
                There are also older dams that have no fish ladder and these are more difficult to traverse. Sometimes we were able to empty
                the canoe and slide it down the face of the dam and then lower the food and camping gear down. One thing that I learned is
                never slide down the face of the dam. I did this once and slid so fast that I scraped my elbows when I tried to control the
                slide. The reason for this was a thin layer of moss that is easy to miss but provides an excellent lubricant for rapid
                acceleration.

                Another danger is the dam with openings on the top that allows some of the water to pass down to the lower level of the
                river. Do not go near these! We did and were quickly sucked into the flow of the water and soon were passing through the
                gap. I saw what was happening and jumped onto the top of the dam as the canoe went through. Then I watched in horror as the
                canoe fell to the bottom and the waterfalls started to fill the canoe. Meanwhile my partner did not know that I was no
                longer in the canoe and called to me to get the canoe from under the falls and then realized that I could not help him and
                he had to move fast and get the canoe out from under the fall of water. This event was compounded by the fact that this was
                the first day of the trip and it took two more days to dry the sleeping bags. You can imagine that we did not have a good
                sleep for a few days. After this I always made sure that our sleeping bags were protected with a number for plastic bags!

                Another obstacle is the grouping of rocks that are used as a walkway across the river. These are easy to pass over as the
                top of the rocks are near the river surface. We just put down a plastic mat and slid the canoe over the rocks and got into
                the canoe on the other side. I also discovered that the bridges all have abundant rip rap underneath as protection from the
                river undermining and scouring the bridge supporting structure. That means that as you approach the bridge, you will hear
                the roar of the water as it passes through this obstacle. The way I dealt with this was to beach the canoe a distance before
                the bridge and scout the area under the bridge to find the best way to navigate this obstacle. There was usually a way
                centered between the bridge supports where the water massed and formed an excellent channel to pass through the rapids under
                the bridge. A few times the obstacle was such that we had to walk the canoe along the edge of the river and avoid these
                rapids.

            <p>
                Another important thing to be ready for is your canoe turning over. The way we prepared for this was to have all our gear
                stored in zippered waterproof bags. Also all of these bags must be tied into the canoe so that if the canoe turns over in
                rapids, your gear will not flow down the river and be lost. Each of the above bags had a handle and a rope is passed through
                each handle of each bag and this rope is secured to as many parts of the canoe including the seats and cross members. Also
                you must be prepared for rain. We had many mats that we placed over the top of the bags to protect them from both the rain
                and the sun. I also found some wooden platforms that we put under the bags so that when water does enter the canoe, these
                bags are above the water and not soaking in it.

                A challenge of any canoe trip of a few days is that one ends up far from your car where you offloaded the canoe and gear to
                the river. On a three day trip you could end up over one hundred kilometers from where you started. On the first trip I took
                my car to where I thought the trip would end and left the car there, slept overnight, and took a train back to the start of
                the trip the next morning. Of course we had put the canoe near the river the night before. In that way we could be near the
                car at the end of the trip, load all into the car, put the canoe on the car roof and continue back to Daejeon because we
                ended up near where the car was spotted. However the next trip, the NakDong (낙동강) River trip between Daegu and Busan, we did
                not end up near where the car was located so it meant that it took a long time to get back to the car and then return to
                where the canoe and my partner were waiting. On future trips I left the car at the location where we off loaded the canoe at
                the start of the trip and at the end of the trip I took a bus back to the car and drove it to the location of the canoe.
                Meanwhile as I travelled to retrieve the car, my partner would organize all the gear and have it ready for loading into the
                car when I arrived later in the day. This is the best and most efficient option as it is hard to know exactly where you will
                be at the end of the river canoe trip. It also means that you can start the trip earlier in the day.

                One experience comes to mind when I decided to hitch hike as I had no idea where the bus terminal was located. I was
                immediately picked up and dropped off at the bus terminal. I the U.S.A I used to do the same thing but was not picked up as
                fast as I was in Korea. I am not recommending this but just stating that this was how I got to the bus terminal at the end
                of the trip at the sea port city of MokPo (목포) along the South Sea because I started in an area where there were no taxis.
                When canoeing on a lake this issue of spotting the car is not an issue as you always end up where you begin.

                On the long trips we usually planned to be self-sufficient. That meant that we tented along the river bank not too far from
                where the canoe was beached with a long rope tied to a tree. We were always careful to bring the canoe up high on the bank
                in case the river rose during the night. Usually it was easy to find a good place for setting up the tent, cooking dinner
                and getting a good sleep. I remember one time when it was becoming late and there were many reeds along the shore so we
                could find any location for the campsite. Just about when we had given up I saw a concrete platform that was on the river
                bank. That is where we tented.

                There was also a time that a large fish, a striped bass, jumped into the canoe and this provided an excellent dinner that
                evening. On another trip it was the second evening of the trip and we ended up near a small city and found a motel near the
                river and slept there. It was a welcome relief from a long day but it was the only time that I did this on a trip as we
                usually did not end the day near any town or city. It was also a wonderful feeling to be far from civilization with no signs
                of people near even though you know that you are living in a relatively crowded country.
