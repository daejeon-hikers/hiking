                This is one of the truly great mountain ranges of Korea so it is no surprise that it has achieved
                National Park status. There are many peaks spread across Gyeryongsan National Park (계룡산국립공원) . Its name
                (계룡) is derived from the view of the peaks that resembles a dragon with a rooster’s crown in the words
                gye 계 (rooster) and yong 용 (Dragon). It was designated as Korea’s 2nd national park, after JiRiSan (지리산)
                further south, in December 1968. Bounded by four cities including Daejeon, GongJu (공주), Gyeryong (계룡)and
                NonSan (논산) means it is accessible easily by public transportation in the case you wish to go up one
                side and down the other. Famous for the beautiful view points from the peaks, which can be verified by
                the reviews found on trip advisor, it is also the location of three famous temples, DongHakSa (동학사),
                GapSa(갑사), and SinWonSa(신원사) which are all located within the bounds of the national park. An abundance
                of natural resources including 3,619 animal and plant species with 11 endangered animal species
                underscores the vital importance of preserving the mountain / valley ecosystem in a small but densely
                populated country like South Korea. Within the Buddhist temples there are also a number of national
                treasures associated with the Buddhist culture that are well worth viewing when you come to climb in the
                mountains. Be aware this designation as a national park means that you cannot bring a pet, like a dog,
                into the park and there will be a small fee to enter the park.

                The park consists of seven valleys and twenty eight peaks with the highest within the park being
                CheonHwangBong (천황봉) at 845 meters in height. This means that it is far from being one of the higher
                mountain ranges of Korea such as JiRiSan (지리산) and the TaeBeckSan (태백산) which are substantially higher,
                but it makes up for this lack of height by having some of the most famous mountain views and nature
                panoramas in Korea. Although CheonHwangBong (천황봉) measures as the highest peak in the National Park that
                can be visited there is some controversy of the exact height of the mountain summit itself , GyeryongSan
                (계룡산), which is shown as 846.4 meters height on naver maps (the Korean version of Google maps). This
                mountain, outside the national park itself, is not open to the public as it is located in a military
                restricted area which has been used for training soldiers.

                I have included a few of the many hikes that can be done in this mountain range. They cover the
                different portions of the range and when you have completed all of them you will have a very good
                understanding of why this is such a popular mountain range with hikers from across the nation. Meanwhile
                there are other trails that you can hike and enjoy what this mountain range has to offer hikers. Look at
                the maps included in the photo section for other hiking options. If you come on a weekend the easy
                pathways around the temples will be filled with families and other visitors’ just out for a stroll or
                having a picnic by the river soaking the summer rays, admiring delicate cherry blossoms or aweing at the
                collage of nature’s finest autumn colors but not intent on climbing mountains.

                We met at KAIST and drove to the main entrance of this park which is a 20 minute drive from the KAIST
                parking lot. The parking fee for the massive parking lot is 4000 won. Then we walked up the road between
                the shops and food establishments to examine a giant-sized map of GyerYongSan national park (계룡산국립공원)
                located opposite the far end of the parking lot. You needn’t worry about getting lost as it is a busy
                route and there are many signs along the way. As a major entrance to the national park you will find
                many amenities located here as well as the Cheonjeong Information center (천정탑방지원센터), the National park
                office and a designated in-season camping ground.

                After reviewing the hiking trail on the map, we walked along the path by a stream eventually turning
                right up the hill and climbed at a moderate grade. The well-known women’s temple of Donghaksa (동학사)
                mentioned in the introduction above is located just beyond the point where it is necessary to turn right
                to reach NamMaetap (남매탑). Once on the path we followed the well-placed signs for SambulBong (삼불봉) peak
                which is 775 meters high. Eventually after a rather steep trail of rubble we reached the saddle between
                two peaks. You know that you are near this saddle when you come to the stairs. At the saddle you bear
                left on a moderate climb up to NamMaeTap (남매탑) where there are two Buddhist stupas located on a flat
                area together with a small Buddhist temple known as Sanwonam (상원암). Look for the plaque explaining the
                story of the two stupa at this historic location. Seeing as how there were many picnic tables at
                Sanwonam, it was a convenient place to eat lunch which we did at 1 p.m. Normally, the view here is
                partially obstructed by the trees but during winter with no leaves on the trees you get a better
                perspective of the various mountains peaks around you.

                After lunch, we continued by hiking up a steep path with many stone steps that led to another saddle. At
                this location we found ourselves very near to the peak. The end was nearly in sight as we turned left
                following the steep path for the next 200 meters to the top. The views of Seojong (세종), Daejeon and
                GongJu (공주) are particularly excellent here but be sure to note the view of the GumGang River (금강) in
                the distance. For orientation purposes there is a plaque that identifies the surrounding peaks of this
                mountain range in the distance with their respective heights. Too soon relaxation was over and it was
                time to return first to NamMaeTap (남매탑) and then we took the longer trail back. We passed through the
                afore mentioned Buddhist temple of DongHakSa (동학사) and retraced our steps of earlier today on the road
                back to the parking lot arriving at the car by 4:30 p.m. Returning to KAIST took about 30 minutes due to
                the heavy afternoon traffic on this day. We also did this hike again both on the 14th of December 2014
                and the 25th of February 2018 although many of the hikers have changed since 2012 as foreigners come and
                go from Korea. Photos on this page are taken from our various hikes.

                Ask any avid hiker in Daejeon and they will concur that this is one of the great hikes in the Daejeon
                area. In general is not an easy mountain to hike due to the rocky nature of the trails but it certainly
                is a favorite mountain to explore because of both its history and the fine Buddhist temples around its
                base. A total a five hikers met at KAIST at 9:30 a.m. We left one car at the end of the trail at GapSa
                Temple (갑사) parking area and drove back to DongHakSa (동학사) Buddhist temple. Although I won’t go into too
                much details about the historical context of Donghaksa (동학사) it is certainly worth pointing out that
                this temple is the oldest Bhikkhuni (female) monk temple in South Korea. Originally built in 724 (and
                rebuilt many times since) during the Shilla dynasty it operates today as a study and teaching center for
                the female monks. The atmosphere of the place does seem to bear witness to a woman’s touch with its
                fragrant lotus flowers and tidy overall appearance. If you are interested in further reading about
                Korean temples in English there are two books that will provide plenty of insight into several prominent
                Korean temples. They are called “Korean temples: Temples from Korea’s Southeast corner” and Korean
                temples: Art, Architecture and History”, both written by Dale Quarrington.

                We started our journey up the first part of a relatively easy trail at 11:00 a.m. however the trail
                became steeper as we approached the saddle where we arrived at 12:55 p.m. Then we hiked along a
                moderately steep trail to the peak SamBulBong (삼불봉) (775 Meters) arriving at 14:00 p.m. This is the same
                peak as when we went to NamMaeTap (남매탑) a month earlier but after leaving the peak this time we hiked
                along the ridge. This is a very rocky area but with very well developed trails although it is still
                difficult to transverse because of the boulders that must be maneuvered around. In anticipation of this
                difficulty, the park officials had railings installed along the trail for protection because of the
                cliffs adjacent to the trail.

                Luckily, we managed to not fall off any cliffs and proceeded to hike along the GumChunDiGoGay (금잔디고개),
                GoGay (고개) means “hill or pass” which in this case is a ridge. At one point we were near to NamMaeTap
                (남매탑) but did not go down to that location as it is a rather steep trail and we were doing a traverse.
                We then continued over the ridge to the north side of the mountain where there was much snow and ice
                requiring us to put on our crampons at 15:36 p.m. We finally reached the upper temple of the DongHakSa
                (동학사) complex which is known as 심우정사 at 16:24 and again arrived back at the main temple below it at
                17:00 pm. From there we drove around to where the other car was located and so ended a thoroughly
                demanding but exhilarating climb leaving us eagerly anticipating our next visit to GyeryongSan National
                Park (계룡산국립공원) .
