                We met at KAIST at 10:00. On this hike were Tina’s daughter and fiancée Balazs who were visiting from Hungary. This hike was
                held on 11th of November, 2018. It was a beautiful fall day with leaves at their height of colors. The location is easy to
                find. Follow Rt. 30 till you see the signs for the famous temple, MaGokSa 마곡사. There is a large parking lot near the
                entrance to the temple complex. At the entrance to the parking lot is a small village associated with the temple complex
                which has several cafes, restaurants and motels for visitors. There is also a public bus here which you can catch from the
                Gongju (공주) bus terminal. The scenic path leading to the temple complex has several food vendors selling traditional Korean
                snack foods. The only negative point is that this is a very popular temple especially on the fall weekends. However once you
                cross the stream from the temple area leading to the hiking paths the crowds become much thinner.

                Despite the crowds, it is worth your while to spend time visiting this temple. Note that “Sa” (사) means temple in Korean. It
                is a beautiful temple complex with the mountains in the background dominating the location. At times companies hold business
                conferences using the temple facilities. This allows companies to conduct business or hold seminars as well as treat their
                employees to the peace and quiet of a Buddhist sanctuary at the end of a hectic work day. It is an opportunity to trade the
                chaotic city life for the relaxation of the country side for a day but still have access to necessary modern amenities.
                There are also camp facilities here for student groups which is part of the Traditional Buddhist Cultural center which
                teaches young people about Buddhist culture and history.

                There is an admission charge to enter the temple complex and hiking paths unless you are a senior citizen. There are many
                trail signs to guide you on your hike. On this particular hike we followed the trails in a counter clockwise direction. This
                trail was quite steep but leveled off when we reached the ridge. On this hike we had lunch around 1:40 p.m. Then we hiked
                along the ridge until we reached NabalBong (나발봉) (414m). Then we started down a steep trail that was a little difficult due
                to the abundant leaves. Some drizzle which began close to the end of the hike also made conditions a little slippery but we
                soon we reached the road that leads back to the temple without mishap arriving at the parking lot arriving at 3:40 p.m. and
                back at KAIST by 5:00 p.m.
